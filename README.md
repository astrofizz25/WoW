# WoW

I took a Foundations of Data Analytics course last fall. Near the end of the course, we were given a final project assignment to perform an exploratory analysis on datasets of our choice. I stumbled upon a [dataset](http://mmnet.iis.sinica.edu.tw/dl/wowah/) involving avatar information collected about World of Warcraft players between 2006 and 2009. Due to limited time to complete the project, I worked with only the first three months of the provided data, but it was still interesting to see how my hands-on experience as a WoW player could be quantified and analyzed. This project was my first attempt at importing, cleaning, and analyzing data. All visualizations are done in base R.
